You have given an array A having N elements and an integer S. You have to find a maximum number X such that the sum of all its subarrays of size X is less than or equal to S.
Example Input:  
    A = [1, 3, 4, 2]  
    S = 7  
Example Output:  
    2  
Explanation:  
    All subarrays of size 2 have the sum less than 7.  
    Subarays are :  
    1. [1, 3]  
    2. [3, 4]  
    3. [4, 2]
